# Go Finances

### Project created to practice usig TypeScript

<div>
  In this project I created some components and for now, I did only one of the pages from the app. 
  But later I'll add the Navigation Bar to add more screens to it. So it'll become more functional and in a way that you can add your expenses or the money you just received.
